**
* Naive Solution
**

    * Description 
        Try adding every combination of unique numbers in the array until the
        target sum is found.
    
    * Time Complexity
        O(n^2)
        This requires a nested loop on the input array. One loop is required
        for each of the two summands.

    * Memory Complexity
        O(1)
        No significant datastructures are required for the naive solution.

**
* Optimal Solution
**

    * Description
        Iterate over the numbers in the array, keeping a (num -> index) map for
        past numbers. As we iterate, check the map for the complementary number
        (target - num). Once we find a match, return the corresponding indices.

    * Time Complexity
        O(n)
        This implementation requires a single iteration over the input array.
        We can put/get numbers from the map in O(1) time using a hash map.

    * Memory Complexity
        O(n)
        This solution requires a map of O(n) size for book keeping.
