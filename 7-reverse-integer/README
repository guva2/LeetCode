* Solution

    * Description 
        The best solution is the naive solution. Simply iterate over the input
        digits from least significant to most significant, and add them to an
        output number from most significant to least significant. The only tiny
        little optimization I made was to check for overflow only when reversing
        the final digit. It is easier, but marginally slower, to check for
        overflow at every digit.
    
    * Time Complexity
        O(n)
        We have to iterate over the n input digits 1 at a time and append each
        digit to an output number in O(1) time.

    * Memory Complexity
        O(n)
        The output number has O(n) digits. No other significant memory overhead
        is required.
