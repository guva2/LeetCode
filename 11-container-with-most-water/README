**
* Naive Solution
**

    * Description 
        The naive solution would be to run a nested iteration over all possible
        combinations of lines and pick out the largest area.
    
    * Time Complexity
        O(n^2)

    * Memory Complexity
        O(1)

**
* Optimal Solution
**

    * Description
        Intuitively, we can deduce that if we have two pairs of lines with
        different lengths, the pair with the shorter length can only hold more
        water if the effective height is taller than the effective height of 
        the pair with a greater length. We can use this property to iterate
        over the lines more intelligently. If we run a double ended iteration
        across all lines while always keeping the longer line in a pair, we
        can guarantee that we will find the maximum area without checking all 
        possible combinations.
