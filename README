LeetCode Problems

This is a personal repository containing solutions to LeetCode Problems. I'll
try to include a README for each problem that discusses complexity, small 
optimizations, and tradeoffs. Note that I'll ignore inputs but not outputs when
analyzing the memory complexity of a solution.

This project uses the following tools to streamline my development process:
    * A Python script that generates skeleton files for new problems
    * Gradle to facilitate building and testing
        * Junit test plugin
        * Jacoco test coverage plugin
        * Checkstyle plugin with a modified version of Sun's coding standards
    * Git for version control

It's worth mentioning that I'll be implementing solutions with functional static
methods because the format works better for simple LeetCode problems than OOP.
This approach (1) lets me easily integrate JUnit and Jacoco to comprehensively
test implementations with 100% test coverage and (2) facilitates copy/pasting
solutions directly into LeetCode.
