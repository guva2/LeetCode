* Solution
**

    * Description
        Nothing fancy. The naive solution is the best solution. Iterate over the
        input number from least significant to most significant digit and
        construct a reversed number by appending these digits to a number from
        most significant to least significant.

    * Time Complexity
        O(n)
        We must iterate over O(n) digits to test the number is palindromic.

    * Memory Complexity
        O(n)
        This implementation requires that we keep a reversed number of O(n)
        length in memory.
